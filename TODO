* Have a list of files which should have their data attributes removed
 (or maybe just do this for all XML files)
* latest-published-at (for feed) (or maybe this should be a pointer to a specific post, how to do this? e.g. "latest->published at")
* Anything else for feed
* Redo the transforms stuff so that it's somewhat pluggable
