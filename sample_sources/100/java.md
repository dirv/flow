<p>Programming languages can be many things, but 
the one thing they rarely are is simple. Simplicity is not even a 
consideration for designers whose chief concern is cramming in as much 
as possible, save for the proverbial kitchen sink.</p><p>One language 
which is sold to us as simple is Java. Its arch-nemesis of the 90s is 
C++ which is indeed more complex, but todayâ€™s world is filled with

these is a flat-out lie.</p><p>Java breeds architectural complexity. Legions of programmers have suffered, are suffering and will continue to suffer its wrath.</p>
