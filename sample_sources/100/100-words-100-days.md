title: 100 words, 100 days
---

<p>We started this new challenge today of writing 100 words every day for 100 days. It sounds pretty difficult to me, only because writing even a single word takes a great deal of energy. School chemistry taught me about the "activation energy" of reactions and I am always reminded of this when I start to do any task like writing. A large amount of effort is required in order to just get started with any task which requires expenditure. Procrastination is a terrible time-waster, ironically enough. It's interesting that if we didn't procrastinate, if we just got down to it, put pen to paper, then it'd be far less energy expended than if we wrote nothing but wasted energy thinking about writing instead.</p>
