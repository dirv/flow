title: The boy and the parrot
---

<p>Ten parrots live in the garden. The garden is just a typical London garden—not big, not small, the grass is withered and the flower beds are empty. The trees have prospered at the expense of everything else, and now the parrots call it home.</p><p>One of the parrots is sitting on the windowsill. She is cleaning her bright purple feathers with her beak. A young boy sits on the other side of the glass. He is reading an adult comic book, not understanding the words but thoroughly enjoying the pictures. The parrot notices this and decides that this particular boy isn’t to be trusted.</p>
