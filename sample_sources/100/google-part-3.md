title: Google, part 3
---

<p>For many years, Microsoft dominated business IT services. Its Office application suite eclipsed all other desktop software offerings: Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook embedded themselves firmly into our daily lives. Outlook&rsquo;s big brother, Exchange, underpinned our connectivity needs, doing away with internal memos and replacing them with email, shared calendars and company-wide address books.</p><p>The powerful Outlook and Exchange combination mimicked and improved upon the very first business collaboration suite, Lotus Notes, created in the late-1980s by Ray Ozzie, one of the world&rsquo;s best-known software developers. IBM bought Lotus in 1995, and for the next decade Microsoft and IBM together propped up the world of business IT.</p><p>Google torpedoed this duopoly with the introduction of its cloud-based web applications: Mail, Docs, Sheets and Slides. The incredibly bland, utilitarian names speak volumes about Google&rsquo;s attitude to creativity: there is none. This dearth of creativity continues past the name, however: the products are direct copies of the Microsoft office suite. Google Docs, for example, acts like a simplified Microsoft Word. Word&mdash;a word processor&mdash;was first released in 1983 but the first version we would recognise is <i>Word for Windows</i>, shipped in 1989. There is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jensenh/archive/2005/10/03/476412.aspx">a great article detailing the history of the Word for Windows interface</a> but for now take a look at this screenshot from that article:</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing that Google Docs looks exactly like this product from 1989? Is it really true that we reached the peak of word-processing innovation over 25 years ago?</p><p>When Word 6 came along, the industry coined the term <i>software bloat</i>, and Word 6 was the quintessentially bloated product. We used to tell the old joke that 90% of its users only used 10% of its feature-set.</p><p>Google Docs, on the other hand, implements 10% of Word&rsquo;s features. The irony is that Google didn&rsquo;t get the joke. The joke was funny because the bloat was necessary for Word to be useful to so many different people in so many different ways. Google Docs is useful in just one way: we are rail-roaded into writing documents that look and read the same. Blandness comes not just from the name but also the software itself.</p><p>But in the end, Google Docs has made a serious dent in the Microsoft Office monopoly.</p><p>I might finally get to why that is in part 4.</p>
