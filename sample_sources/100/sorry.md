title: Sorry
---
<p>There isn’t a single good reason why we did the things we did that night, and I can’t tell you any words that will mend any of the damage we’ve done to you and your family, but maybe you’d like to know what brought us to that point. Even though we realised that what we were doing was wrong in every way imaginable, we had reached the point of no return, and the events passed from being unthinkable to inevitable, from secret thought into nightmarish tragedy. We can’t move on from this, I’m sure, and I’m aware that my apology—and you must know that I am indeed sorry, for this was the gravest of errors—is worth very little to you today. All is now harmed.</p>
