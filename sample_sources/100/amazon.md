Remember the time when we learnt how [ambulances were stationed daily at one particular warehouse in the US](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/inside-amazons-very-hot-warehouse/), awaiting the inevitable casualties caused by the intense sweatshop heat and the overlong shift patterns? This was, in case you weren't aware, an Amazon distribution centre.

Many people boycott Amazon because of these sweatshop conditions imposed on its workers. Other reasons for boycott exist: just last week saw the publication of a New York Times article about the high-pressure, workaholic culture that exists at Amazon (or, perhaps, if you believe Jeff Bezos, had previously existed but no longer does).

Culture shifts are difficult once entrenched and I find it unlikely that Amazon has changed markedly. Amazon is an example of the new age of global corporate entity and, like Google, is at its core culpable for many insidious practices. This new age demands that when the media's glare falls on a particular immoral practice--such as sweatshop labour--the company deny all knowledge and make hasty changes to its policies and processes in order to cover up any perceived wrongdoing.

Amazon acts in a similar way to the investment banks that we have already learned to dislike. The New York Times portrays an environment within Amazon that is a very similar to an investment bank.

Amazon evades taxes via financial instruments like offshore tax havens. These instruments are only available through the support of the investment banks. Small businesses pay tax on the standard way, since these instruments are out of their reach. They are therefore at a serious disadvantage over a company like Amazon. How exactly is, for example, an independent bookstore meant to compete against an unfair, more powerful competitor?

But again, this is the new age of corporate entity, and stifling competition is priority number one. Corporations exist in a game of "survival of the fittest" just like people do. The documentary "The Corporation" explores this idea and I highly recommend you watch it.

Why do Amazon get away with immoral practices? Because they dress up their motive--survival--with a very provocative story of consumerism: cheap, abundant product delivered within the tiniest of time periods. One must remember that, as I explained with Google, communication often has two components: a surface meaning and an ulterior meaning. Here the surface meaning allows Amazon to get away with its ulterior meaning, which is, essentially, _profit by demeaning the human experience to that of slavery_.

As an aside: Jeff Bezos, I'm very sure, didn't mean to end up at this point. The book "The Everything Store" discusses Bezos and Amazon in detail and is a great read if you're curious.

I don't think you should boycott Amazon. A boycott suggests that it is a temporary arrangement. I suggest permanently removing Amazon from your life. The first step to doing this is realising that consumerism is not necessary for your survival. You do not need all these "things" that you regularly procur. Learn to be content with what you have. Cut down on your spending, and when you do spend, don't spend with Amazon.
