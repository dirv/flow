<p>I woke up at 4am today, wide awake and ready to go, which is interesting because I only got to bed at 1am. My body clock was telling me that it was time to wake up. But because I’d travelled across back in time 6 hours, it wasn’t really time to wake up. It was 4am. What this has taught me is that I could probably pull an all-nighter if I wanted to: it’s just a matter of getting through the difficult three hours before I’d usually wake, so 6am-9am. I may put this theory to the test when I get back to London, either with a night of non-stop coding or with a night of non-stop clubbing. <br></p>
