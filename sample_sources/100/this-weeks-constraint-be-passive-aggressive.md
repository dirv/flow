title: This week’s constraint: Be passive aggressive
---
This week’s rule comes from _Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer_ by Roy Peter Clark:

> Be passive-agressive. Use passive verbs to showcase the "victim" of action.

This appears as Tool 4 in the book. If you don't already have access to a copy of the book I'd suggest getting hold of a copy.

The passive voice calls attentions to the receiver of the action. Used judiciously, it can have a great effect.

> The best writers make the best choices between active and passive.

So, now that the active voice has been mastered, try to use the passive voice in *one* of your sentences each day, emphasizing the receiver.

Each tool in the book ends with a Worskhop section. This tool ends with the advice to read [George Orwell's essay "Politics and the English Language."](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit) I'd suggest doing that before embarking on this task.
