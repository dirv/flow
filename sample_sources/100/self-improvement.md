There are thousands of published books on the topic of self-help. Most of these books discuss symptoms: being late, disorganised, angry, depressed, and so on. But the best self-help books talk not about symptoms but about causes, and usually these causes are things that happened in childhood.

It’s during our childhood that our emotional self develops. A good example is “love”: we learn about love by watching our parents and sensing the love they have for each other. If our parents don’t love each other, or there is only one parent in the family, then how can we be expected to ever understand what _true_ love is?

The term “dysfunctional family” sounds quite horrific, and yet a dysfunctional family is more common than a functional family. I know this because it’s easy to spot children of functional families. They are calm, emotionally balanced, at peace with the world, and generally quite successful in life from an early age. It suffices to say that this does not apply to me. And it doesn’t apply to the majority of people I’ve ever met.

The child of a dysfunctional family has a couple of options. One is to keep ones head buried in the sand and endure the daily struggle with adult life. The other option is learning to cope. Coping means not just understanding your personality but also accepting it. And learning to cope means gaining knowledge about the human condition, through reading, through discussion, perhaps through psychotherapy.
