<p>Martin Luther King wrote the following in 1963:</p>

<blockquote><p>Over the past few years I have consistently preached that
nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as
pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that
it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But
now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even
more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.</p></blockquote>

<p>— <i>“Letter from Birmingham Jail”, King, Martin Luther Jr.</i></p>

<p>This was said in the context of racial injustice and was aimed at the police force of the time, which King believed to “have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral end of racial injustice.”</p>

<p>Although there is much to be said about policing in the 21st century, today I want to focus on another facet of life where this rings true: the corporate entity.</p>

<p>“Do No Evil” is the motto of one of the largest corporations in the world, Google. But often when a business says one thing, they actually mean the opposite. That’s because, just like with human communication, business speak can have dual meanings. There is the overt meaning: “we never do anything wrong.” Then there is the covert, ulterior meaning: “our business practices suggest that we are doing something immoral. But we aren’t—honest!”</p>

<p>Google’s core business is harvesting data. This is something that no one of should be particularly comfortable with.</p>

<p>Imagine an alternative universe where Google is coming of age and showing us how great it can do search compared with the likes of Yahoo!, AltaVista, and Lycos. It is beginning to experiment with advertising based on your search keywords. In this alternate universe, however, it never mentions the “do no evil” motto. Instead it says nothing. It just leaves you to decide, based on the evidence presented to you. But without those comforting words, would you have trusted it?</p>

<p>Google’s motto is about winning trust, not about stating facts.</p>

<p>In part 2 coming tomorrow I’ll discuss Google-riddance, the process of de-Googlifying your life.</p>
