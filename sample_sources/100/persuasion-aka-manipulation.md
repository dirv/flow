<p>Here are two statements that I judiciously remove from my writing.</p><blockquote><p><i>“It’s my belief that…”</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>“I think…”</i></p></blockquote><p>For example, rather than write:<br></p><blockquote><p><i>“It’s my belief that Clojure is a superior language.”</i></p></blockquote><p>I’ll write:</p><blockquote><p><i>“Clojure is a superior language.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Depending on how trusting you are of me, you may believe this to be fact, when, in fact, it is actually just my opinion.</p><p>This is a favourable situation for me because it means that you are more likely to come round to my way of thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Here are two statements that I like to insert into my writing.</p><blockquote><p><i>“It’s a simple fact that”</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>“People say”</i></p></blockquote><p>These two are usually blatant lies, but who are you to argue? Placed at just the right moment, and buried within a long paragraph, you will not stop to question it. Instead, you’ll simply frame the idea in your head with just a pinch more credibility than you’d otherwise give it.</p><p>Lately, I have been playing with adding and removing similar figures of speech to my speech. Soon I will be a master manipulator. And that’s a fact.</p>
