I am &quot;offline&quot; for the next few days. I am _en route_ to a field in Leicestershire for four days of dancing, yoga, getting muddy, dressing up, dressing down. My summers are always highlighted by the required August Bank Holiday Festival. This year, it&#x27;s Shambala.

One thing I never understood is why apps are terrible at &quot;offline mode&quot;. Connectivity is never guaranteed on mobile devices, especially when one is in the middle of a field. So why do some apps refuse to work without connection? One app that stung me recently is Tumblr. During a recent journey I wrote several hundred words within the Tumblr app, without connectivity, and when I hit &quot;Save&quot; my masterpiece was promptly sent to /dev/null.

Another annoyance is Apple Music. This app has been recently updated. It was called iTunes before. Now, if there&#x27;s no network connection it just sits blank-screened while it figures out what the hell it&#x27;s meant to be doing. I am not joking about this. It is just unresponsive for large swathes of time. I bet you any money that if I open it now (I have one bar of signal) it will do exactly as I have described.

Why? How hard is this, exactly? Answer: not hard. Not hard at all. Why??????
