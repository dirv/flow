title: Testing, part 2
---

*Manual testing* is undertaken by individuals deemed by their managers to be not good enough to write code. This truism is never stated but it is implicit in the software industry. These poor souls are doomed to mediocracy, for there is little career progression or satisfaction to be had as a &ldquo;tester&rdquo;.

*Automated testing* is undertaken by people who know how to code but are deemed not good enough to be let loose on actual software. This judgement is bestowed upon them by the same people who judged the manual testers. Ironically enough, these people are likely to turn out to be better coders than the actual developers because they&rsquo;ll develop a strong appreciation for software quality.

*Testing*&mdash;seen as an integral part of the software developer&rsquo;s role&mdash;is undertaken by software professionals. These are people who enjoy writing software that works; these are people who enjoy _writing it right_. They understand that specifying behaviour up-front not only negates the need for both manual and automated testing but also surpasses the value of both combined. This is the thinking that underpins *test-driven development*.
