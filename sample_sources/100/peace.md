<p>You can walk over the Albert Bridge, jog the grounds of Stormont Castle, row across the Lagan and stroll along its Towpath, you can drink the length and breadth of the Golden Mile, get lost in the Botanic Gardens, admire the grandeur of the Harland &amp; Wolff cranes, drive through the Falls and the Shankill, you can climb up Cave Hill, you can play in Belmont Park and walk along the Newtownards Road, move around the grounds of Donegal Square and then towards College Square East, but nothing, absolutely nothing can prepare you for a taxi ride along the Belfast Peace Walls.</p>
