title: This particular parrot
---
This particular parrot is not very handsome. His tail feathers have weakened from malnutrition and are bleached from the strong midsummer sun. His eyes show the world-weariness that one might expect to see in a parrot twice his age. Premature ageing caused by the heavy London mindset. Life here is frenetic. One is always rushing, ignoring other parrots, being completely preoccupied, avoiding eye contact at all costs. Birdsong is a definite no-no.

Why any parrot would choose to live here is beyond me. I can tell from their confused daily routines that most of these parrots have no idea why they are here.

This particular parrot knows why. He knows why because he brought them here.

Maybe it&#x27;s not London after all. Maybe it was what came before.
