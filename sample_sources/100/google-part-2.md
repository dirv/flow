title: Google, part 2
---

Becoming a critic of any system requires that we remove ourselves from said system, unless we wish to be labelled hypocrites. A well-known example is vegetarianism: those who disagree with the mechanics of the animal agriculture industry will instinctively stop eating meat.

We do not have a collective pronoun to describe those of us who have instinctively stopped (or, tried to stop) using Google. Interestingly enough, it's easier to give up meat than it is to give up Google.

I call it _Google riddance_. It is not an easy, one-step task, as Google infiltrates our life just as industrial pollutants seep from industrial factories through the ground, into the rivers and enter the food chain. Google permeates through all aspects of our existence. This sorry state of affairs would have been unthinkful just two decades ago. Laws protecting against anti-competitive practices like those which caught Microsoft still exist, but Google has been smart enough to act in such a way that they can never be labelled as anti-competitive. Always operating under the radar, they have silently become one of the world's most powerful corporations.

Tomorrow I will look at one reason why Google-riddance is hard.
