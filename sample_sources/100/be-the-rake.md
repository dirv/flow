title: Be the rake
---
Rakes rock my world. If there’s one thing I’ve always said about myself, it’s that I love a good rake. At work we have taken to saying: _be the rake_. A rake is a garden implement that is often found lying on the ground, teeth pointing up, waiting for a victim. These types of rakes are dangerous because they are hard to see. The most dangerous type of rake is the one that hides in long, uncut grass. If one approaches and accidentally stands on the rake, then the rake instantaneously swings upwards and BAM! Right on the noggin. Ouch.
