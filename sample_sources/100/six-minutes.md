<p>I have roughly six minutes to write this post. I should have written it this morning, but then work got in the way. Then I thought about writing it at lunchtime, but Pinaclj got in the way. I wanted to write it in the afternoon, but conference calls got in the way. I tried to write it when I got home, but I prioritised yoga instead. I could have written it after yoga, but instead I went for a cycle. I could have written it after my cycle... actually, thatâ€™s what I am doing.<br></p><p>How on Earth am I going to keep up this habit in Chicago!?</p><p>Oh, and it only took me four minutes.</p>
