They never had to wash dishes for the entire family of ten, as I did; they never had to sweep the leaves from around the house in autumn, as I did; they never had to mow the lawn in summer, as I did; they didn’t have to vacuum the stairs, clean the bathroom, wash the windows, as I did. The four younger kids didn’t have any of the work that I did.</p><p>And how did they turn out?</p><p>Just about as good as the rest of us.</p>
