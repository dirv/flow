title: The bridges of Chicago
---
<p>Now that I’ve been here a week, I can safely say that my favourite part of the Chicago cityscape is the Main Stem of the Chicago River, for a couple of different reasons.</p><p>Firstly, the walk along the Chicago Riverwalk is close to perfect: the banks of the river are beautifully landscaped and clean, and the sunken walkways provide tranquility away from the noise pollution of the Loop.</p><p>Secondly, the numerous bridges which span the river—in just 1.5 miles of river there are ten bridges located on Outer Drive, Columbus Drive, Michigan Avenue, Wabash Avenue, State Street, Dearborn Street, Clark Street, La Salle Street, Wells Street and Franklin Street—are understated and simple, but each shares the same steel design and paint job that together creates a beautiful frame over the top of the river.</p><p>The best view—in my humble opinion—is to be had whilst stood on the Riverwalk looking west, just before State Street Bridge, with the Marina Towers on the right (the Marina Towers being a topic for another post) where you can look directly down the river seeing the water entirely capped by the steel bridges, giving the river a tunnel-like quality.</p><p>The Chicago River’s bridges and the Thames River bridges in London have very little in common. I think I prefer the bridges of Chicago.</p>
